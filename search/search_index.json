If the supported repositories listed below will not meet your needs, choose a trusted repository that follows international best practices by offering:</p> <ol> <li>A public landing page for your dataset/research product.</li> <li>A unique identifier, which may be a digital object identifier (DOI), and a persistent URL (the URL does not change) for accessing the landing page for your dataset/product.</li> <li>A formal citation for your dataset/product.</li> </ol> <p>You can find directories of data repositories at https://www.re3data.org and https://fairsharing.org.</p> <p>We provide the general guidance with regard to supported repositories below, but we are happy to discuss any questions you may have and make more specific recommendations:</p> <ol> <li>HydroShare: A general purpose repository for submitting water-science related datasets and models. Submit datasets, models, and other research products that are water-related. This includes time series of hydrologic observations, time series of data from weather stations, geospatial datasets, etc. HydroShare is flexible and allows upload of files having any format. HydroShare also includes a linked JupyterHub server if you wish to upload executable Jupyter Notebooks using Python or R with your content. For information about how to submit to HydroShare, you can access HydroShare\u2019s help system at https://help.hydroshare.org.</li> <li>EarthChem: A repository for submitting data derived from material samples such as soil, sediment, pore water, or rock specimens; cores; and other physical objects. Primary focus is on geochemical, geochronological, petrological, and mineralogical data. EarthChem strongly recommends use of data submission templates available on the EarthChem web site (https://earthchem.org/ecl/templates/) that provide guidance for properly documenting data quality and provenance. Though data can be contributed to the EarthChem Library in a wide range of formats (https://ecl.earthchem.org/fileformat.php), it always needs to be documented with relevant information regarding the analytical data quality. Submission guidelines for EarthChem can be accessed at https://www.earthchem.org/ecl/submission-guidelines/. For help, go to https://earthchem.org/resources/support/earthchem-library-documentation/ or write to info@earthchem.org. Regardless of whether you submit directly to the EarthChem Library or you submit to the EarthChem Library through the CZNet Data Submission Portal, you shoud review and use the templates and guidance for your data files linked here.</li> <li>Zenodo: A catch-all repository that may be an appropriate place to upload content that is not appropriate for the other repositories. Zenodo does not limit what you can upload and is not domain specific. For more information about Zenodo and submitting data, see https://zenodo.org/record/787445.</li> <li>SESAR: A sample registry that catalogs sample metadata, sample images, and other information to make samples more discoverable, accessible, and reusable. SESAR allows you to get an IGSN for your samples, a globally unique identifier that is essential for unambiguously citing samples in datasets and publications (https://www.igsn.org). Use SESAR to submit metadata about your samples and obtain IGSN Global Sample Numbers. Resources for researchers can be accessed at https://www.geosamples.org/resources/researchers, and tutorials and FAQs can be accessed at https://www.geosamples.org/resources/help.</li> <li>OpenTopography: A repository that facilitates community access to high-resolution, Earth science-oriented, topography data and related tools and resources. Submit high resolution topography data acquired with lidar and other technologies. A tutorial describing how to submit data to OpenTopography can be accessed at: https://cloud.sdsc.edu/v1/AUTH_opentopography/www/docs/CommunityDataspaceTutorial.pdf.</li> </ol> <p>If you choose to submit your data or research products to a repository other than the ones listed above, we will still need to know about those submissions.

Assemble and document them as early as possible after generating them (it will save you time later), and register them within one of the above repositories. You need not wait until your data are ready for formal publication. HydroShare, EarthChem, and Zenodo all offer the ability to upload private content, allowing you to capture and store your data safely while your research and publication process is ongoing. Then share and publish when you are ready. Register your samples online in SESAR.</li> <li>Create a descriptive title for your data product: Put some thought into the title of your dataset. See the guidance in the section below about how to construct a descriptive title for your dataset.</li> <li>Tag your data with appropriate metadata: Use the repository\u2019s submission form and templates to enter descriptive metadata for your products. Metadata should include information needed to discover and cite your products, but also additional information required to interpret your content (e.g., procedures used to collect or analyze samples or observations).</li> <li>Use common, open, and accepted data formats: We know that the data you are creating are diverse and that there is not always specific guidance for how to organize your data and which file formats to use. We have provided some links to general data management resources in the section at the end of this document. If you have questions about what to do, please contact us.</li> <li>Include a \u201creadme\u201d file: A readme file can include detailed information about the structure or content of your data or research product. It can also be used to describe how to perform specific analyses to make your research results more reproducible. If you upload a \"readme.txt\" or \"readme.md\" file to your resource in HydroShare, it will be displayed on the landing page for your resource. Using \"readme.md\" allows you to use markdown formatting in your readme file that will be rendered on the landing page for the resource.</li> </ol> <p>We have included links to additional documentation that may assist you in preparing your datasets and research products for sharing and publication.

If your keyword is a phrase, capitalize only the first word (e.g., \"Water quality\"). If your keyword is a proper name, capitalize the first letter of each word (e.g., \"Logan River Watershed\").</li> <li>Avoid misspelling or using variants of the same keyword (e.g., use \"Temperature\" consistently rather than \"Temp.\")</li> <li>Full phrases will have more meaning, but add acronyms if you want to enable discovery using that term. For example \"Logan River Observatory\" is more informative than \"LRO\", but some users may want to search using \"LRO\". In this case you may want to add both.</li> <li>Keywords may be a single word or several words (e.g., phrases), but keep them very brief.

The purpose of coverage information is not to visualize the spatial or temporal qualities or complexity of your data. Instead, it is meant to provide viewers with information about where the spatial and/or temporal region to which the data are applicable. The following are recommendations for specifying spatial and temporal coverage for the different repositories supported by CZNet:</p> <ul> <li>HydroShare: HydroShare represents spatial coverage information as a bounding box or a discrete point in space. You can choose which to use, and you can input the coordinates for the bounding box or point manually or by using the map control to draw the point or box on the map. HydroShare allows you to enter the temporal coverage as a time period by choosing a starting and ending date. </li> <li>EarthChem: The EarthChem repository allows you to specify the spatial coverage as \"Global\", \"Regional (Continents, Oceans)\", or \"Space/Planetary\" along with adding geographic keywords. EarthChem then draws coverage information from the coordinates associated with the dataset's individual samples. Samples must be registered with SESAR and receive IGSNs for this association to work correctly. </li> <li>Zenodo: The Zenodo repository does not include spatial or temporal coverage information as part of its metadata. If you want to share a resource in Zenodo and you want to specify spatial or temporal coverage information, you could add this information to the \"Additional notes\" metadata field in Zenodo.</li> <li>Other Repositories: If you are using the Data Submission Portal to register a dataset from a different repository, specifying the spatial and temporal coverage is the same as for the HydroShare repository.</li> </ul> <p>NOTE: The CZNet Cataloging and Discovery system includes a filter for data temporal coverage. Given that specifying the temporal coverage of your dataset is optional, only datasets that have information for temporal coverage will respond to this filter. The CZ Hub team is also working spatial filtering capability, which, similar to temporal coverage, will only work for those datasets for which spatial coverage information is specified.</p>"},{"location":"data_publication_guidance/#provide-funding-agency-information","title":"Provide Funding Agency Information","text":"<p>It is best practice to provide an acknowledgment to the agency or funding source that provided the support under which data/research products were produced.

Depending on the variable, data type, and data transmission system, raw data may be available within seconds or minutes after the measurements have been made. Examples include real time precipitation, streamflow, and water quality measurements. 1 Quality controlled data Quality controlled data that have passed quality assurance procedures such as routine estimation of timing and sensor calibration or visual inspection and removal of obvious errors. An example is USGS published streamflow records following parsing through USGS quality control procedures. 2 Derived products Derived products that require scientific and technical interpretation and may include multiple-sensor data. An example is basin average precipitation derived from rain gages using an interpolation procedure. 3 Interpreted products Interpreted products that require researcher driven analysis and interpretation, model-based interpretation using other data and/or strong prior assumptions. An example is basin average precipitation derived from the combination of rain gages and radar return data. 4 Knowledge products Knowledge products that require researcher driven scientific interpretation and multidisciplinary data integration and include model-based interpretation using other data and/or strong prior assumptions.

For example, see the Federal Geographic Data Committee\u2019s (FGDC) geospatial metadata standards and guidelines at https://www.fgdc.gov/metadata/geospatial-metadata-standards. Metadata describing geospatial datasets usually conform to one of these existing standards. Generalized data repositories like HydroShare and Zenodo use high level metadata to describe resources (e.g., HydroShare uses the standard elements from the Dublin Core metadata standard) for the purposes of data cataloging and discovery and do not have many of the specific metadata elements needed to sufficiently describe geospatial data. You should think of the high-level metadata used by a repository like HydroShare as the metadata required to find and access the data, whereas the more detailed metadata required for a prospective user to understand the data and decide how and/or whether it can be used for a particular purpose should be included in a separate metadata file that is uploaded with the data. Given this, we strongly recommend that you include a metadata file with each geospatial dataset that describes at minimum:</p> <ul> <li>The spatial reference system used by your geospatial data</li> <li>Definition of the data set entities and attributes - i.e., what are the features in your dataset and what are their attributes, including units</li> <li>Methods/manipulations/transformations/processing \u2013 include processing, methods, tools used, transformations applied, normalization, etc. that were used to format data layers for analysis. Also describe specific software used.</li> </ul> <p>For resource-level metadata in HydroShare or Zenodo (the metadata that will support discovering your geospatial data), we recommend creating titles, abstracts, keywords, and other high level metadata that will help prospective data users discover your resource. Be brief but descriptive with your title, and include useful information in your abstract. Choose keywords that you think people who may be interested in your data will use to search for it, which may include place names, observed variables, topics, etc. Keep in mind that the more detailed geospatial metadata you provide as part of the resource\u2019s content files will not be indexed for discovery purposes.

Some of the important considerations include:</p> <ul> <li>How do you want the data to be discovered and accessed? It may be convenient for you to chunk time series data by data collection site. In this case, you can create a HydroShare resource for all of the time series data for a particular site. This makes it easy for potential data users to discover and access all of the data for a particular data collection site in one place.</li> <li>How do you want the data to be cited? You should think of your data as research products that can be cited. Each resource in HydroShare has a separate citation and can be published with a digital object identifier (DOI). You may choose to organize data into a set of HydroShare resources based on how you want them to be cited as products.</li> <li>How will the data be used? If you know investigators will want to use the data in a particular way, you may want to organize the data into a set of files that will make that easier \u2013 e.g., assembling a time series into a single file that is easy to read/work with rather than splitting data into multiple files that then have to be stitched back together.</li> <li>What is practical for managing the data? If you are dynamically updating data files in HydroShare as new sensor data become available, it may be practical for you to chunk data by year (i.e., one file per year) so that you only have to edit/update the most recent year\u2019s data file when new data become available.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"time_series_data/time_series_data/#additional-best-practices-for-time-series-data","title":"Additional Best Practices for Time Series Data","text":"<p>The following recommendations are not meant to represent an exhaustive list but will provide relevant guidance.

Depending on the variable, data type, and data transmission system, raw data may be available within seconds or minutes after the measurements have been made. Examples include real time precipitation, streamflow, and water quality measurements. 1 Quality controlled data Quality controlled data that have passed quality assurance procedures such as routine estimation of timing and sensor calibration or visual inspection and removal of obvious errors. An example is USGS published streamflow records following parsing through USGS quality control procedures. 2 Derived products Derived products that require scientific and technical interpretation and may include multiple-sensor data. An example is basin average precipitation derived from rain gages using an interpolation procedure. 3 Interpreted products Interpreted products that require researcher driven analysis and interpretation, model-based interpretation using other data and/or strong prior assumptions. An example is basin average precipitation derived from the combination of rain gages and radar return data. 4 Knowledge products Knowledge products that require researcher driven scientific interpretation and multidisciplinary data integration and include model-based interpretation using other data and/or strong prior assumptions. An example is percentages of old or new water in a hydrograph inferred from an isotope analysis."}]}
